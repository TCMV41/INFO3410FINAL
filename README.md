3rd Attempt, multiple databases crashed and did not work due to case sensitivity. Project runs perfectly on localhost however problematic on hosted MYSQL databases as they usually have dont allow case insensitivity as we're accustomed to.

Administrative credentials for testing:
-email:admin@admin.com
-password:password
